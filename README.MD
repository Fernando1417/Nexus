# Nexus Automation Framework

Accessible automation for common file and image tasks, delivered in two flavors:

*   Excel assistant for non-technical users
*   CLI tools (Bash and Python) for power users

The goal is a consistent, extensible framework rather than one-off scripts, with feature parity across implementations where it makes sense.

## Vision

*   Consistency: Shared behavior and options across Excel, Bash, and Python.
*   Accessibility: Excel workbook for easy, guided use without installation.
*   Power & Extensibility: Scriptable CLIs with presets and batch workflows.
*   Maintainability: Clear structure, tests for core logic, and good documentation.
